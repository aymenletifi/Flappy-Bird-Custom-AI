# Flappy-Bird-Custom-AI

After implementing the NEAT Algorithm and creating an AI that played Flappy Bird , I got more interested in reinforcement learning so I decided to implement my own evolutionary
Algorithm to deepen my knowledge in reinforcement learning . It's a simple evolutionary algorithm based on neural networks and there is still a lot of room for improvement but this project got me more interested and more eager to learn and dive deeper in this field.
